# 2022 Q1 Hyperledger FireFly

FireFly is doing great, and is expected to release v1.0.0 at the
beginning of Q2. New community members are participating in discussions
in Discord. The move to Discord has been a huge positive change for the
FireFly community, and it is much more active than Rocket Chat ever was.
New contributors also continue to make contributions to the project.

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

There are no issues at this time.

# Releases

The full list of releases can be found at:Â 
<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases</a>

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Discord is very active, and project maintainers are usually fairly
prompt in answering questions there. Community calls are still happening
every other week, though attendance has definitely declined, starting at the beginning of the year. Code activity is very high, as the team
progresses toward the v1.0.0 release.

# Current Plans

The v1.0.0 release is the next major release, though there may be
several patch releases before then. For detailed progress on v1.0.0,
please see the GitHub project board:Â 
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/projects/4/views/3" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/projects/4/views/3</a>

Beyond v1.0.0, there are several other major features, for which
development will begin immediately following v1.0.0:

-   Multiple ledger/blockchain support
-   Active-active High Availability for FireFly Core

# Maintainer Diversity

New maintainers (since last report):

-   David EchelbergerÂ 
<a href="https://github.com/eberger727" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/eberger727</a>
-   Hayden FussÂ 
<a href="https://github.com/hfuss" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/hfuss</a>

# Contributor Diversity

Contributions in Q1 including code, documentation, or other
contributions:

Active contributors from Kaleido: 10

Active contributors from other organizations: 3Â 

# Additional Information

FireFly continues to make great progress, especially in technical
enhancements. The community however, still needs to grow. We would love
to see more users, contributors, and maintainers join the community. A
very slow stream of new contributors wanting to get involved in the
project continues to be a challenge. Those contributors gaining enough
technical familiarity with the project, and being willing to take on the
responsibilities of a maintainer poses an even larger challenge. These
are obstacles to moving to a Graduated Project status. Any assistance
that the Hyperledger Foundation can provide in overcoming these
challenges would be appreciated.

<p>Under the "Maintainer Diversity" section, you list two new
maintainers (congratulations) who are both from Kaleido. Are there
currently any maintainers who are not from Kaleido?</p>
<p>You also mention that you are having a hard time getting people to
take on the responsibilities of a maintainer in the "Additional
Information". What is the typical reason for this? Do you have someone
(maybe a sponsoring maintainer) who is helping to mentor new
contributors to becoming a maintainer?</p>

<p>Thanks Tracy. Right now all of the maintainers are from Kaleido.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">Part of my role is connecting
with other developers and helping them get plugged into the project. I
regularly make myself available to chat over Discord or Zoom if someone
is interested in contributing and needs guidance on where to start.</span></p>
<p>We've had quite a few contributions from people participating in
hackathons, or students who want to make open source contributions to
build their resume and get experience. We've had a couple contributions
from someone at another organization that is using FireFly for their
business. But we haven't seen anyÂ  <em>consistent</em> contributions
over a period of time from anyone outside the maintainers. You ask wh"at the typical reason for this is, and I wish I knew. I could speculate,
but it would just be speculation.</p>
<p>Maybe it's awareness of the project? When we do hackathons or
meetups, everyone seems really excited about FireFly, but only a small
number follow through and actually make a contribution.</p>
<p>Maybe it's that it feels too challenging for contributors to take on
larger, more complicated tasks like architectural changes? This is a
tough one because the project is moving so quickly right now.</p>
<p>Thanks for following up on this though, and I'd love to continue the
dialog about how to grow the community and get more maintainers and
contributors.</p>

I think part of the issue with finding new maintainers is that it takes
time.Â  People don't show up with all the knowledge and experience they
would need to become a maintainer but they can get there.Â  I'm
encouraged to see that there is a stream of new contributors wanting to
get involved, so my recommendation is to keep doing what you've been
doing and to also look at providing resources for people to get beyond
their first contribution.Â  Like we talked about recently, one or more in
depth technical workshops, for instance, can help people get more of
that experience.</p>
<p>And I agree that it is a challenge for someone new to take on a big
complicated task especially when the project is moving quickly.Â  One
thing to do here is make sure there are plenty of less complicated tasks
newer people can take.Â  I scanned through the FireFly issues list and
saw just <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">two issues marked as a good first
issue</a> .Â  Perhaps there are others that I didn't see, but in general
having a longer list of initial tasks for those new people showing up is
a good practice.</p>

<p>You may already be doing this, but the other question that comes to
mind is how much of the work is being done in the open. That is, how
much is done in the day-to-day interactions within Kaleido vs. ensuring
that the discussions and designs are done in the open where anyone can
contribute and participate? Ideally, people will be able to see the
conversations that are ongoing related to particular feature development
and provide thoughts on designs in an effort to ensure that the
knowledge is open. This will allow for people who may not be in the
day-to-day to at least gain knowledge without having to depend on
waiting for someone to come on line to answer questions or provide
direction.</p>

<p>I am assuming multiple features were developed in the previous
quarter. These include features such as "Custom smart contract support" which was in progress in the last report. This feature specifically is a
big encouragement for anybody to adopt FireFly as a framework to build
their blockchain applications. I was curious because the current quarter
activity says it was coding intensive period without mentioning the
specifics.</p>
<p>Amazing work, looking forward to the v1.0.0 release, best of luck to
the whole team.</p>

<p>Is there any production deployment of firefly ? To make people
understand how firefly can be used ,people need case studies. Â Releasing
v1.0.0 and announcement of existing production deployment system built
on Firefly. Â I think proper marketing required how and who is using
FireFly inÂ production.</p>
<p>Best of luck for V1.0.0 , looking forward.</p>

suggestion about production case studies is a good one. In fact, we have
folks from both Synaptic Health Alliance and Riskstream Collaborative
joining a panel to talk about this very thing in the FireFly 1.0 launch
webinar. Hopefully highlighting this type of thing more will help build
momentum for the project.</p>

# Project Health

* Hyperledger Solang development is going well. Work on the Soroban target is carried out, with the supervision of the Stellar Foundation.

* Solang Playground now supports compilation in the browser, marking the second milestone of the Web3 Foundation Grant as done. 

# Questions/Issues for the TOC

There are no issues at this time.

# Releases

* Hyperledger [Solang v0.3.4: Athens](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/pull/1639), is currently being worked on by Cyrill Leutwiler. It is not yet published.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

## For Solang
* For the newly added Soroban target, work on supporting a `counter.sol` contract was underway. The purpose was not only to support simple contracts, but to build a `skeleton` whereby new functionality can be easily added to Soroban contracts.

* Vendor `forge-fmt` into the Solang repository, as the published forge-fmt is out dated, not maintained, and depends on an old version of solang-parser.

## For Solang-playground
* Work on supporting compilation in the browser was carried out, and submitted to W3F for review.


# Current Plans

* Work on Soroban target till maturation.
* Improve Solang Playground UI/UX, making it more visually attractive.
* Make content involving Solang/Solang-Playground, including Tutorials, Video content, documentation improvements, etc ...

# Maintainer Diversity

Alongside the four active maintainers Sean Young, Lucas Steuernagel, Cyrill Leutwiler, and Salaheldin Soliman, it is worth mentioning that Solang Playground has added a new maintainer: Tarek Naser, once a hyperledger mentee.

# Contributor Diversity

Most contributions were made by core maintainers, alongside some issues being solved by community members.


# Additional Information

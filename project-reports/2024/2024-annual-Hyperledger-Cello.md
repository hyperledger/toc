## Next Year's Goals

The roadmap has been proposed and discussed in the weekly meeting, and there's meeting note on the latest roadmap.

We are on the phase of migrating to latest fabric LTS of v2.5 in the year 2024.

Main 2024 goals:
- Have major release of v1.1, which will focus on project stability and bug fixes.
- Support new blockchain features from fabric LTS of v2.5.
- Support chaincode operations.

## Help Required

Attract more advanced developers to join the project, who is familiar with blockchain technologies and full stack development experience.

Most issues are addressed in the weekly meeting now. Recently there're new users to come to attend the meeting.

# Project Lifecycle Stage Recommendation

Incubation is good now, and we plan to upgrade to graduated status with new major release this year.

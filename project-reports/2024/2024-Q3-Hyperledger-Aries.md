## Project Health

Work on [Hyperledger Aries] continues at a healthy pace, with lots of activity
in all of the Aries and the related-OWF sub-communities. [Aries Cloud Agent
Python] continues to move to its 1.0.0 release, and the community around
[Aries-VCX] is again growing, with lots of work happening in moving the
implementation forward. [Open Wallet Foundation]-hosted [Credo-TS] and [Bifold
Wallet] continue to evolve rapidly. [Animo Solutions], key maintainers of
[Credo-TS], were selected by the German Government as a funded participate in
the [Funke] ("sparkle") initiative to create innovative wallet prototypes in
preparation for the promised German [EUDI Wallet] to be released by 2026.
Exciting times!

## Releases

The following Aries releases occurred in the last two quarters (including the
time covered by the Annual Report and so not yet reported):

- [Aries Cloud Agent Python] -- 0.11.1, 0.12.0, 0.12.1
- [Aries Askar] -- None
- [Aries VCX] -- v0.64.0

Interoperability status can be seen
here: [https://aries-interop.info](https://aries-interop.info).

## Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Per the [Aries Activity Dashboard] for the months of April-June 2024, Aries
codebases had 3185 Commits and 275 contributors representing at least 28
organizations.  The numbers do include the repositories
that have moved from Hyperledger to the Open Wallet Foundation, as well as some
obsolete (but unchanging) repositories. Per Ry Jones there is not a good way for
us to control the included list of repos.

- The [Indy SDK] has been removed from ACA-Py, eliminating the older component in favour of newer and more capable
  replacements ([Aries Askar], [Indy VDR], and [AnonCreds RS]). Good to see that
  transition!
  - **NOTE: THIS DOES NOT REMOVE INDY SUPPORT FROM ACA-PY!**
- Support for AnonCreds in W3C VCDM Format in Aries has been implemented in [Aries Cloud Agent Python].
- Work has begun on adding [DIDComm v2] support in [ACA-Py].

## Aries Framework Reports

### [Aries VCX]

Lots of work has been happening on Aries VCX with the release of 0.64.0 and
0.65.0, and it has also gained new maintainers, contributors and support from
Instnt.

The releases have included updates to the AATH (Aries Agent Test Harness) Aries
VCX Backchannel to include the latest 0.65.0 updates and implement processes for
continuous deployment of the backchannel. As part of the efforts updating the
backchannel, work has occurred to resolve interoperability issues between Aries
VCX and Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) within DID Exchange, adding support
for DID Exchange 1.1 and did:peer numalgo 4.

Release 0.65.0 marks the planned final release including support for the
indy-sdk, credx, and indyvdrtools crates and features in Aries VCX. The
replacement for these crates are already implemented (Aries Askar, anoncreds-rs,
and indy-vdr) in Aries VCX. Additional info or discussion can be found here.
Work is underway to remove these dependencies from the project.

Work is in-progress on fixing and enhancing fixing Android support, as well as
adding support for iOS. Support for usage via React Native will be considered in
the future as well. Additionally, work is planned and underway to improve the
overall ease of use of Aries VCX to boost its adoption.

### [Aries Cloud Agent Python]

[Aries Cloud Agent Python] (ACA-Py) work in the quarter has focused on the
upcoming Release 1.0.0. Almost everything is in place and as this is being
written, the last PR for the release is being reviewed. Real Soon Now! Details
about the updates and changes in the release can be found about about the
release from the [ACA-Py Release Candidate changelog].

The maintainers of ACA-Py are in the process of adding a Long Term Support (LTS)
policy for the project, modelled on the Hyperledger Fabric LTS approach. We have
two LTS versions at this time (0.11.x and 0.12.x). Once stabilized, there will
be a 1.x LTS minor release declared as well.

Transitioned the sourcing of the ACA-Py documentation site [https://aca-py.org]
to be from the ACA-Py repo itself.

## Current Plans

- Releasing v1.0.0 of ACA-Py.
- Deploying support for [AnonCreds in W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model Standard] format.
- Continuing working to add support for [DIDComm V2].
- Adding support for the [`did:tdw` DID Method], including support for rooting AnonCreds Verifiable Credentials using a `did:tdw` DID
- Moving to Phase 2 of two Community Coordinated Updates ([793], [496]) in effort to deprecate old practices and adopt replacements in a coordinated effort.

# Project Health

The 2024 forecast for Solang is showing growth despite the number of pull requests and reported issues going down, Here are the three reasons why:

1. Stellar organization decided to fund Solang long term, to add Soroban as a compilation target.
2. Work is ongoing in [Hyperledger Solang Playground](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang-playground), a web IDE that will enable easy onboarding to the Solang ecosystem. Funding is provided by the Web3 Foundation.
3. [Hyperledger Solang-Aqd](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang-aqd) (a smart contract CLI tool) was developed in the 2023 mentorship, by Tarek Naser, and it will be integrated into Solang Playground.

# Maintainer Diversity
- Another maintainer from a different organization has been added: Salaheldin Soliman. His main tasks are to add Soroban as a compilation target and on-boarding production projects to Solang.
This makes Solang have 4 maintainers from 3 different organizations: Solana (Sean Young and Lucas Steuernagel), Parity (Cyril Leutwiler), and Stellar (Salaheldin Soliman).

- Sean Young and Lucas Steuernagel have been redeployed to other projects within Solana, but they will continue contributing to Solang by reviewing pull requests and addressing issues.

# Project Adoption

The maintainer team has identified the issue with Solang's slow adoption in 2023: the lack of developer tooling and advocacy. Although a lot of work has gone into making a full-on compiler for Solidity, we need to provide easy ways for Solidity developers to start using Solang. The maintainer team will work on tutorials and easy-to-use tools to supplement Solang.


# Goals

## Performance Against Prior Goals
Prior goals for Solang mainly involved making Solang more attractive to Solidity developers as stated in the 2023 [Q4 plans](https://github.com/hyperledger/toc/blob/gh-pages/project-reports/2023/2023-Q4-Hyperledger-Solang.md#current-plans)

There have been many contributions to that cause, but they involved Solang itself and not its sidecar tools.


## Next Year's Goals
The main goal is to on-board more users and production projects to Hyperledger Solang. More work will be put into Solang Playground and Solang-Aqd to make it easier for Solidity developers to start using Solang, as well as tutorials to encourage production projects to use Solang.

## Help Required
The maintainer team is 100% development oriented. We would need technical writing support from the Hyperledger team to review tutorials and explanations related to Solang.

# Project Lifecycle Stage Recommendation

We would recommend Solang to stay in the incubation phase until its sidecar tools (Solang Playground and Solang-Aqd) have reached maturation.

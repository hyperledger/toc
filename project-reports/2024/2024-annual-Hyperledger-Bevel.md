# Project Adoption

Based on what we see in the mailing list and discord channels there is significant adoption activity.
Few large vendors and several smaller companies are using Hyperledger Bevel for DLT network automation.

# Goals

## Performance Against Prior Goals

### Goal: Major Features
- Bevel general availability release v1.0 (completed)
- Bevel Documentation restructure and redesign (completed)
- Fabric v2.5.x support on both projects (completed)

### Goal: Growing the Community
- Blog post on Bevel release v1.0 (published)
- Hyperledger meetup featuring Bevel release v1.0 (50+ participants)
- Workshop on Bevel and Bevel-Operator-Fabric (90+ participants) 
- Hyperledger meetup featuring Bevel Fabric Operator supporting fabric 3.0

## Next Year's Goals

### Goal 2024: Major Features
- Network deployments using just helm charts
- Add support for cloud managed vaults
- Use of Kubernetes operator for network orchestration
- Stability of the operator and support of Fabric v3.0 using bevel-operator-fabric

### Goal 2024: Growing the Community
- Workshop and demos on upcoming changes and features

## Help Required

- Continue to work with Hyperledger staff to identify contributors and potential maintainers outside current maintainers and orgs.
- Mention Hyperledger Bevel as a means for deployment (on Kubernetes) on documentationsâ€™ of Hyperledger projects such as Fabric, Besu, Indy and Aries.

# Project Lifecycle Stage Recommendation
Currently in `incubation`, has potential to be `Graduated`.

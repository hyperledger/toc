# 2019 Q3 Hyperledger Aries

Created by Sam Curren, last modified by Silas Davis on Aug 29, 2019

# **Projects**

##### **Language Libraries**

-   Python SDK
-   JS SDK
-   Ruby SDK
-   Go Framework
-   .Net Framework

##### **Client Tools**

-   Aries Cloudagent Python
-   Aries Staticagent Python
-   Aries Protocol TestSuite

##### **Shared Components**

-   aries-sdk

# **Project Health**

Aries is a new project, but with good roots in Indy. Some things have
made the transition well (RFCs, Agent code), and some things have been
more complicated than anticipated (relevant portions of indy-sdk).

The community is active, and we are actively filling in missing areas.

# **Issues**

### **SDK Migration from Indy**

The launch of project Aries is an important step in encouraging
interoperability among the various agent implementations. Aries is now
responsible for defining the communication between agents, and will
provide language frameworks that people can use to implement agents th"at comply with Aries standards.

Progress made:

-   Hyperledger Aries as the new home for interoperable agent work.

-   Previous work in the Indy project has led to quick releases of some
Aries components:

-   -   Aries Cloud Agent - Python,
-   Aries Static Agent - Python,
-   Aries Framework - Go,
-   and the Aries Protocol Test Suite.

Further remediation planned:

-   Continue standardizing agent communication protocols in the
Hyperledger Aries Project.
-   Move the relevant parts of the Indy SDK to become an Aries library
that is shared by the Aries language frameworks.
-   The remaining parts of the Indy SDK will evolve into a ledger
resolver that matches the resolver API defined by Aries.

### **Maturing Support for Language Libraries**

As language libraries develop, we need to establish guides and standards
so that the library interfacesÂ  are consistent between languages.

Future work planned:

-   Schedule sdk and framework review during community meetings. This
will raise awareness of progress as well as development and style
decisions. As inconsistencies are identified, work to find common
design and resolution.
-   Further work on Aries SDK to provide a more common foundation for
language libraries.

### **Build Pipelines**

We have not yet build any pipelines for the Aries assets. Part of the
challenge here is the wide variety of languages and platforms being
served.

Future work planned:

-   Choose initial projects for CI/CD pipelines.
-   Develop test pipelines for initial projects.

# **Releases**

##### **Aries Staticagent Python 0.2.0**

-   Initial Release

### **July 2019:Â Â Â **

##### **Aries Cloudagent Python 0.2.0**

-   Initial transfer of project to Hyperledger

##### **Aries Staticagent Python 0.3.0**

-   Improved Routing
-   Trust Contexts
-   Expanded Tests

### **August 2019:**

##### **Aries Cloudagent Python 0.3.1**

-   Credential flow improvements
-   DID Based Invitations
-   Multi-use Invitations

##### **Aries Staticagent Python 0.4.0**

-   Switched libsodium libaries, easing installation
-   Improved Module Definitions

# **Overall Activity in the Past Quarter**

**General**

-   Transition related Indy HIPEs to Aries RFCs

-   Established two regular community calls: one transitioned from Indy,
a new alternate timezone call on a biweekly basis

-   Transferred codebases from BCGov and Streetcred

-   Aries SDK migration from Indy SDK

-   -   Significant area of focus
-   Dependant codebases are continuing with Indy SDK as a
foundation, with plans to switch to Aries SDK as it matures.

-   Development of Protocol Test Suite

# **Current Plans**

##### **General**

-   **Credential Exchange Standards:** We will finalize the current
version of the Credential Exchange Standards and begin discussion on
the next versions. This will allow a fixed target for development
while removing the development stress from the standards
discussions.

-   **Agent Tools and Testing:** The Aries Protocol Test Suite exists
already, but with minimal support for the number of protocols
currently in several of the adopted codebases. Expansion of these
tests will facilitate interoperability between disparate projects.

-   **Coordination with DIF Interop Project Efforts:** The Decentralized
Identity Foundation has begun a project that involves issuing
credentials between various vendors. Aries will play the role of an
Enterprise Agent and issuer of credentials.

-   **Other features planned:**

-   -   Open-source Mobile Agent
-   Desktop Agent testing and administration tools

# **Maintainer Diversity**

The weekly Aries call has been maintenance focused, and we have not
needed a separate call to coordinate maintenance issues. RFC status and
progress is coordinated mostly via these calls and the
\#aries-maintainers channel on rocketchat.

Contributed codebases have remained the focus of the contributing team
with initially few contributions from others in the community. We are
working to expand contributions by regularly reviewing project progress
and status and inviting others to join efforts as maintainers.

# **Contributor Diversity**

In addition to the weekly call that transitioned from the Indy Agent
working group, we have added a bi-weekly US Morning call in order to
better serve our European contributors. This has been well attended and
will continue.

# **POCs, Pilots, Projects**

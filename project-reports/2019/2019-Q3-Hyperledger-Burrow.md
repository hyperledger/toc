# Project Health

Burrow has seen an uptick in issues on GitHub and questions on
Hyperledger chat, and also the return of a prodigal contributor. The
last quarter has been a bumper one for new features, see below. Burrow
desperately needs to document and publicise its existing features
better.

# Issues

Issues on GitHub highlight the difficulty that new users have getting
started with the project. Much of this comes down to a lack of
documentation or stale documentation. On that latter, a cluster of new
features meant to help spinning up single-machine bare metal networks
made some invalidated some of the instructions in our getting started
guides. In another instance two incompatible flags where used in a code
snippet which made the example throw an error. None of this was very
hard to fix but it's a dumb way to lose contributors and users. I have
no measurement but I'm sure this hurts our 'contributor funnel'.

We can fix this by:

-   Using a markdown pre-processor to include snippets and make them
part of our integration testing.
-   Write basic docs across our entire feature set.

Neither of these are that hard but realistically we need help/more
resources to get this done. I would like to make it an aim for this
quarter to get Burrow to '100% tested docs coverage' - meaning we at *least* Â  talk about every main feature of Burrow even if the docs are
rubbish/incomplete. And where we have example code and scripts we run
them with our CI so they don't go stale.

To try and drum up support I plan to do the following:

-   Write a summary Burrow newsletter (I'm going to call it \`Burrata\`,
the first one will be \`Burrata 1\`). Given our mailing list
subscription numbers I think this would be best primarily published
as a blog post on Hyperledger (who should I talk to?). I'll then
syndicate from Monax social media and blog channels. In the post I
will sum up Burrow features, talk about new and experimental
features, and beg for documentation help.

My aim is to exclusively focus on documentation contribution - which
would include writing some example code. If anyone wants to get up to
speed on Burrow this would be a good way to do it. We are not looking
for perfect docs at all. The markdown pre-processor testing harness
might be moderately interesting for other project/in itself if you are
in to that sort of thing.

Any advice/help from TSC appreciated.

# Releases

dump, no empty blocks (massive space saving)
-   **<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/releases/tag/v0.26.0" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">v0.26.0</a>** - Tendermint
upgrade, vent store chain\_id for restore chains

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

There has been plenty of development, the vast majority from Monax
employees, including:

-   Experimental WASM support
-   Vent supports append only SQL log mode - supporting SQL-based event
queues from EVM events
-   Elective validator bonding - validators may now bond and unbond
themselves as they come online (on develop)
-   On-chain Ethereum ABI storage and contract metadata - EVM contracts
now self-describe names, functions, signatures, types (develop)
-   Massive performance improvement in merkle tree by increasing node
size
-   Command line tooling for forensics (why did this production
validator break with quorum?)
-   Command line tooling for sending transaction (without a deploy.yaml
script)

# Current Plans

As above we need to have a push on explaining Burrow and documenting.

Technical challenges include:

-   Improving our state mechanism - we use
<a href="https://github.com/tendermint/iavl" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/tendermint/iavl</a> but it has
scaling issues with large state trees - we have a experimental
replacement in the works:
<a href="https://github.com/monax/trieste" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/monax/trieste</a>
-   Expanding our WASM syscalls - we would like to collaborate with
Transact and will consider what eWASM is defining
-   State channels via ad-hoc Tendermint sub-networks (for privacy, for
scaling)
-   Scheduled transactions - ability to schedule transactions for a
future block height and/or time - including ProposalTx

# Maintainer Diversity

No new maintainers. We have 4 from Monax, 2 non-Monax

# Contributor Diversity

We have 3 new non-Monax contributors.

<p>Just thought questions - not looking for direct responses... If you
restructured Burrow to shrink scope could that benefit the project and
maintainers? e.g. If Burrow was just an EVM or just an &lt;X&gt; would
it be more successful - less to document, easier to learn, more widely
adopted?</p>
<p>Could Burrow become multiple projects?Â  Same scope but split among
different projects so components could evolve at their own pace and be
adopted more easily?</p>
<p>What is the maintainers' overall goal for Burrow?</p>

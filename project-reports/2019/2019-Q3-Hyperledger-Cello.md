# 2019 Q3 Hyperledger Cello

Created by Baohua Yang, last modified on Nov 08, 2019

# Project Health

<span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">Project health is largely the same
as in previous update. The community is makingÂ  changes to make Cello
more of a production ready tool. Features and capabilities are now more
based on common use cases and behaviors of the Blockchain applications.
Weekly meetings often see 10+ participates and often run about 60
minutes due to discussions and questions.</span>

# Issues

There are no major issues at this time. There is increasing requirement
for the new features of the planed v1.0.0 release.

# Releases

-   v0.9.0:Â Support v1.1/v1.2 fabric in k8s agent,Â Add v1.3 capabilities
to ansible agent.
-   v1.0.0: Most of the changes to the project are towards this release.
We like to be very cautious and prudent on this release and will not
rush it out.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

-   Ansible agent continued with many features additions:
-   Continue working on Interop artifacts generation, join request,
orderering system endpoints and certificates integration
-   Added agent creation function on user dashboard
-   Adding Fabric K8S operators with the Intership
-   Talk with Justitia proposal submmitter to bring the proposed
functions/idea into cello and/or basically merge its work into Cello
-   Keep working on the newÂ governing model and relevant APIs.
-   Based new and future cello work on fabric 1.4.2 (community decision)
-   Designed and implemented the new dashboard for the new APIs.
-   Updated the document for the new architecture.
-   Bug fixes.

contribute to cello continuously (3 month) will be nominated.

# Contributor Diversity

<span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">Contributions to the projects
maintain the similar rate as Q2. Lot of discussions on bringing user
management components from a third party which already has the function
in their product. </span>

# 2019 Q4 Hyperledger Fabric

Created by Christopher Ferris, last modified by Gari Singh on Nov 08, 2019

# Project Health

Fabric continues to grow and mature. Our v1.4.3 release was delivered on
Aug 26. We have experienced a slight decrease in the diversity of
contributors with IBM comprising 43.0% of the contributors over the past
quarter (+3.4%). We are still actively interested in growing
contributions and expect the transition from Gerrit to GitHub will lower
the barrier for contributions.

# Issues

As noted, while the diversity of contributions and contributors is
decreasing, we need to do better. We have updated the contribution
process/policy to a GitHub specific flow for those repos we have already
transferred. Hopefully, as we work through some of the CI/CD issues
vis-a-vis releases, we will finish the migration. We hope that can be
sometime in Q4.

# Releases

As noted, we released v1.4.3 with no major new features, but some bug
fixes and with some deprecated features such as Solo orderer and CAR
chaincode format. We plan a 1.4.4 and 2.0 release later this quarter.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

There are a good mix of questions in chat, email and onÂ 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hyperledger-fabric" class="external-link" rel="nofollow" title="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hyperledger-fabric">Stackoverflow</a>
Â â€“ now over <span style="color: rgb(36,39,41);">4.3k </span> questions
(an increase of over 300 since June) for the 'hyperledger-fabric' tag,
with the majority being answered. The questions themselves continue to
be increasingly sophisticated, which is also a good sign.

There has also been a good deal of new major contributions being
proposed and started. Fabric performance (which for a DLT is actually
pretty decent) is receiving lots of interest with various proposals for
optimizations that can yield significant performance improvements, with
one of them being implemented for v2.0. Additionally, there's ongoing
work on a new command-line interface and more.

v2.0 is firming up with a new chaincode lifecycle available, and new
options for chaincode build/launch available. Additionally a large
amount of tech debt has been completed in the areas of automated test,
CI, and code cleanup.

# Current Plans

We expect to deliver our next set of fixes in v1.4.4 in November, and
expect to deliver v2.0 by end of year.

# Maintainer Diversity

No changes in maintainers, as always we would like to expand the
diversity of maintainers.

# Contributor Diversity

We have experienced a slight decrease in the diversity of contributors
with IBM comprising 43.0% of the contributors over the past quarter
(+3.4%). We are still actively interested in growing contributions and
expect the transition from Gerrit to GitHub will lower the barrier for
contributions.

# Additional Information

We are still working through some aspects of how the new CI/CD process
will work for Fabric, and so we have temporarily halted the transition
from Gerrit beyond the 2 repos we previously moved as guinea pigs. We
hope to have the full migration complete by EOY.

# Project

Hyperledger Avalon

# Project Health

<span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">The Avalon team has been progressing
according to its 2020 plan. 0.6 version was released in July. Currently
team is working towards 0.7 releaseÂ that targets end of 2020.
Incremental deliverables include support for multiple workers and
multiple worker processing enclaves (aka WPE) in the worker pools,
improved support for Kubernetes and Docker containers, porting to CentOS
(in addition to Ubuntu). The team is on track to deliver Graphene based
workers and DCAP attestation support for Intel SGX TEE. The team started
Avalon Python SDK project, initially, in the Hyperledger Labs.Â  Â  Â </span>

# Releases

The team has released 0.6 release in July that includes

-   Delivered initial worker (aka enclave pool) implementation with key
isolation
-   Initial K8S support
-   Improved cryptographic support in python modules by utilizing
"native" Python libraries instead of SWIG wrappers for C++ code,
supprt for MbedTLSÂ 
-   Dockerised front-end load balancer (Nginx based) to distribute
transactions to multiple listeners
-   Prototyped Graphene runtime integrationÂ Â 
-   Improved CI support and test coverage
-   Substantially improved project documentation and added Oxygen auto
API spec generation and expanded WiKi documentation

The team currently working towards 0.7 release scheduled at the end of
2020 with an intermediate incremental deliverables with 3 weeks cadence.



# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

After completing the 0.6 release in July (see above), the team has been
building additional functionality towards 0.7 release that included

-   Worker key refreshÂ 
-   CentOS support
-   Improved front-end load balancing that includes support for HAProxy
and K8SÂ 
-   Significant progress towards extending SGX attestation model to
support 3 <sup>rd</sup> Â party attestation (aka DCAP)
-   Work in progress on the integration of the high-level Graphene LibOS
runtime into Avalon
-   Started work on Avalon Python SDK

These capabilities simplify Avalon worker development and expand
supported use cases, e.g. Graphene integration enables AI, ML, and video
analytics use cases.Â 

Due to Covid19 community activity was lower than we would like, but

-   The team continued regular Avalon Technical Forums with good
attendance
-   The project was presented at theÂ Virtual Meetup with Hyperledger
Avalon and Chainlink
-   The project was also actively presented and discussed at EEA Trusted
Compute Work Group

# Current Plans

The Avalon team has moved from quarterly releases to less frequent
releases (every 6 months) with incremental (tested and operational)
incremental functional deliverables at the end of each three-week
sprint. Current plan includes

-   A major project release 0.7 at the end of the 2020Â 
-   0.8 release in Q2 of 2021 focused on the code stability and
robustness (aka "active" stage candidate)

0.7 release targets following functionality (relative to 0.6 release)

-   Finalization of worker pool implementation, key refresh
-   Support for multiple KME (Key Management Enclave) for the worker
pools (aka scalable key management)
-   Kubernetes integration with elastic compute support
-   Multi-tenancy support by utilize SGX KSS (Key Sharing and
Separation) to dedicate a TEE enclave for processing workloads from
a specific requester only
-   Extending SGX attestation model to support 3 <sup>rd</sup> Â party
attestation (aka DCAP)
-   Integration of high-level LibOS runtimes (Graphene and, optionally,
Occlum)
-   Improved and expanded load balancing (HAProxy and K8S)
-   Porting to CentOS
-   Improved test automation into CIÂ 
-   Refining Avalon Architecture with focus on auto-scaling,
multi-tenancy and TEE runtime integration

Many of the capabilities above are already in progress and either has
been completed or on the track to be completed in September.

The team will continue to look for the online opportunities and will
publish technical blogs and user case studies along with additional
video tutorials.

# Maintainer Diversity

The team welcomed Divya Taori as a maintainer for Avalon Python SDK. The
SDK is temporarily hosted at a Hyperledger Labs. We expect it become a
part of the overall Avalon project before end of the year and Divya to
become an Avalon project maintainer.



# Contributor Diversity

Avalon project gets contributions and participation from multiple
companies â€“ Intel, WiPro, IBM, iExec, Kaleido and Santander. The project
team sees a lot of interest from a number of companies including ASUS,
ConcenSys Health and Chainlink. Nevertheless, community growth in Q3
2020 was relatively slow, primarily, due to Covid19 impact. To grow the
community in Q4 of 2020 and in the first half 2021 the team will need to
be more active in utilizing on-line industry events and publishing more
video tutorials, blogs and case studies.

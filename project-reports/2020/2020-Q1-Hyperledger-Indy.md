# Project Health

Indy is a healthy project. Indy‚Äôs codebase has 25886 commits from 182
unique contributors. This represents an increase of 5 contributors this
quarter and about 1900 additional commits. Forums and chat channels are
monitored and a variety of participants are contributing helpful
responses to questions.

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

We continue to track some of the same issues as in <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/2019+Q4+Hyperledger+Indy" rel="nofollow"><span>previous quarters </span></a> .

### **Measuring the size and make-up of our user community**

Update:

We didn‚Äôt move forward with this effort in the past quarter.

Future work planned:

-   Work with Hyperledger to get analytics about web sites, and Rocket
Chat usage.¬†
-   Begin measuring usage of the Sovrin forums: new contributors,
questions asked, and questions answered
-   We will also explore the use of Github's contributor tool.¬†

### **Build Issues**

Update:

The volunteers who were working on migrating the build from Jenkins to
GitLab CI were not able to complete a functional system. The build is
complex due to the variety of target environments for LibIndy and the
requirement of running an Indy Node pool for testing. The approach taken
in Jenkins is significantly different than the approach favored by GitLab CI or Azure Pipelines, and migration will require significant
effort.

Future work planned:

-   We need a new commitment from the various teams who have expressed
interest.

### **Diversity of Contributor Community**

Update:

As agent implementers have moved to the Aries project, Indy was left
with few contributors to the ledger who all primarily come from a single
organization. The health of the project requires broadening this list.

Future work planned:

-   Current initiatives are being led by different organizations, which
we hope will become consistent contributors in the future.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

In the past quarter, ledger development has focused on refactoring the
most complicated parts of the system. This has included a lot of bug
fixing, automated testing, documentation, and polish. Work on the client
libraries has been focused on adding support for the new Aries protocols
and planning the evolution to fit into the proposed Aries architecture.
This has also included a lot of bug fixing, documentation, and polish.
Indy Rocket-chat channels have daily activity where questions are posed
and answers are regularly given.¬†

# Current Plans

Ledger development is currently focused on adding support for Verifiable
Credentials as defined by the W3C working group, which we are calling
‚ÄúRich Schemas‚Äù. Our focus for client libraries is to break LibIndy into
separate components that can be evolved to fit the proposed Aries
architecture. By the end of the quarter, we would also like to be
working on improved revocation.

# Maintainer Diversity

The weekly Indy Maintainers call continues to be the medium by which
maintainers coordinate work, discuss critical issues to the Indy
codebase, and agree on HIPEs. The Maintainers who work exclusively on
Indy is decreasing as many of them move on to help with the Hyperledger
Aries project.

# Contributor Diversity

Evernym is still the primary contributor to ledger development, but the
Rich Schemas effort has been led by the team at the Sovrin Foundation,
and the team at British Columbia Government is leading the effort to
evolve LibIndy. Smaller contributions have been made by representatives
from Kiva, Absa, IBM, Deutsche Telekom, and four independent
contributors.

# 2020 Q1 Hyperledger Iroha

# Project

HL Iroha

# Project Health

The last quarter was not a very active one from the code perspective
although the chats are very much alive, we receive questions (and reply
to them), and although there are not so many new contributors but there
are new users who, we hope, might join as contributors someday. The
atmosphere in the community is great. Burrow integration is almost
completed. Talked to Explorer maintainers and working closely with them
to add Iroha support into their master branch.Â 

We also started collecting ideas for new versions of Iroha â€“ to make it
better.Â 

A book was published in Japan about HL IrohaÂ

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

We do not seem to have many questions at this point.Â 

# Releases

We did not have releases in this period (since we've been preparing the
1.2 with tricky integrations).Â 

Last release wasÂ 
<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/releases/tag/1.1.1" class="external-link" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: underline;">Release 1.1.1</a> <span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">Â on 20th of September </span>

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Code-wise, we've been concentrating mostly on ITF, testing and finishing
integrations with Ursa (as it is only possible now to build the project
with it â€“ we want it to be also applied in the runtime) and Burrow (lots
of testing required as it is a difficult project to add). Chats are
active, we might get more attention as a big project on Iroha was
announced publicly.Â 

Another thing that happened is that we changed the schedule of calls -
now they are bi-weekly and start earlier. Â 

# Current Plans

We are planning 1.2 release (maybe with 1.1.2 first) â€“ it will include
the final version of Burrow integration and an audit is planned for it.
Also, we are collecting requirements and ideas for new releases (if you
have any, let us know!). Also, we are preparing our maintainer,Â 
<a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/~lebdron" class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="lebdron" data-linked-resource-id="9109570" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.hyperledger.org">Andrei Lebedev</a> for HGF,
so he could talk about Iroha there.Â 

# Maintainer Diversity

Alexander Lednev joined us (iceseer on GitHub)

# Contributor Diversity

We've got a contribution fromÂ claudiocandio as a new contributor.

Still looking for more contributors.Â 

# Additional Information

No additional information, it seems.Â 



UPDATE from 13th of February: we also fixed Iroha SDK for Caliper and
waiting for a review:Â

<p>We started talking publicly more about Bakong - national payment
system of Cambodian National Bank:Â  <a href="https://bakong.nbc.org.kh/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://bakong.nbc.org.kh/</a></p>
<p>It was in testing (with several banks only, though with real money in
real stores and with real people) for some time and it is getting fully
operational now, afaik.</p>

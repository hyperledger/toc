# 2020 Q1 Hyperledger Besu

Created by Grace Hartley, last modified by Gari Singh on Apr 27, 2020

# Project Health

Besu is strong and growing. This quarter Besu has prioritized fostering
the community around Besu and delivering its 1.4 Release.

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

-   RocketChat continues to present an unneeded point of friction
bringing in members from the larger Ethereum community. We are
considering linking a different chat channel (Slack, Gitter) to
RocketChat to assist this friction and give community members a
separate entry point.

-   The Besu team would like the TSC to consider <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Hyperledger+Besu+Active+Status+Proposal" rel="nofollow"><span> Besu’s active status proposal </span></a>
again along with this quarterly report. 
-   Additionally, we have another organization, WhiteBlock building
on Besu. ETC has been supporting Besu generally as well as
contracted WhiteBlock to add keccak256 PoW mining.

-   -   The diversity of the project has continued to grow with an
additional maintainer from a new organization onboarded. We now
have 4 separate organizations represented with maintainers.
-   We previously received feedback from the TSC to continue to
demonstrate usage of Hyperledger tools, which we have done since
onboarding. We are currently transitioning to GitHub issues.
-   Non-PegaSys contributions have been 28% of the contributions
since our prior quarterly report.

# Releases

Besu has released one minor version update (1.4, 26 Feb) and six
bi-weekly patch releases (1.3.7 on 13 Dec through 1.4.1 on 13 Dec, 18
Dec, 15 Jan, 29 Jan, 12 Feb, 26 Feb, 12 Mar respectively). 

Major functional improvements include:

-   PlugIn APIs
-   New tracing APIs
-   Multi-tenancy
-   Advanced key management
-   End-to-end encryption TLS

information on the feature improvements.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

A few high-level activities include:

-   Continue to run our bi-weekly contributor calls and grow the
attendance
-   We have been using the Hyperledger tools consistently and with
general success. Onboarding onto RocketChat is still a barrier for
some community members.
-   Team is transitioning to GitHub Issues from Jira issues.
-   A security audit on the Besu codebase has been in progress by Tevora. The final report is due on Friday, 3/27.

As a part of joining the Hyperledger community, the Besu team has
participated in the community by:

-   Continuing to work on Besu’s support of Caliper, including 5 commits
to date

-   Presented on supply chain SIG

-   Attended the Hyperledger Global Forum and presented several talks

-   Attended Hyperledger meet-up in Phoenix

-   Presented at Hyperledger Korea meet-up

-   Provided proposal on DCO process for Hyperledger

-   Approved to be Co-mentor with Mark Wagner on Hyperledger mentorship
project to have Besu run on OpenShift

-   Published a couple of blogs on Hyperledger’s site:

# Current Plans

The Besu project team has several upcoming priorities:

1.  The project team is currently working towards its 1.5 Release,
scheduled for June 2020. The 1.5 Release is expected to include the
following features:

2.  1.  Performance improvements: Performance is a high priority item
for the Besu team at this time to ensure it’s a leading Ethereum
space. Some of the improvements will include block propagation,
block product and validation, transaction pool management, and
JSON RPC query response time. 
2.  Privacy Improvements
3.  Beam Sync Early Access
4.  Mining Support

3.  The Besu team is also continuing to focus on finalizing and
publishing performance metrics with its work on Hyperledger Caliper.
The publishing of the metrics was slightly delayed since last
quarter because there remains additional work for the team to get
the range of metrics and tests it requires. The team is currently
working on this task. We still believe publishing these performance
metrics will help provide the community additional context on the
project’s usability for a variety of use cases.

4.  Similar to last quarter, Besu is also continuing to engage with its
community and grow the diversity of its maintainer and contributor
base. The Besu team is hoping to continue to grow attendance for its
bi-weekly contributor calls to grow engagement across contributors.

# Maintainer Diversity

Our maintainer diversity is growing.  We have maintainers from four
different organizations at this point in time. This is an additional
organization since the previous quarter.

The four organizations include:

-   ConsenSys (PegaSys)
-   Web3Labs
-   Chainsafe
-   Machine Consultancy (new as of this quarter)

The new maintainers this quarter include:

-   Antoine Toulme (Machine Consultancy)
-   Stefan Pingel (PegaSys)

We are planning on likely downgrading a couple of maintainers in the
upcoming quarter because of their lack of recent Besu contributions.

The maintainers breakdown is currently:

-   13% non-PegaSys

# Contributor Diversity

Commits from 2019-12-09 to 2020-03-20 : 252

Committers from 2019-12-09 to 2020-03-20 : 33

Identified Orgs 2019-12-09 to 2020-03-20 : 7 + 3 independent committers

<p>I assume you mean this page -  <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Hyperledger+Besu+Active+Status+Proposal">Hyperledger
Besu Active Status Proposal</a> ?<br />
I updated the numbers in the Community Support section based on git log
analysis and added some downstream code users in the "Other
Considerations" sections. </p>

gone ahead and updated the top section of the Active Status Proposal
with the latest information. Apologies for being delayed on the
updates.</p>

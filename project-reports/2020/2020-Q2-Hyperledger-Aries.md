# 2020 Q2 Hyperledger Aries

Created by Sam Curren, last modified by Christopher Ferris on Jun 25, 2020

# Project Health

Project health continues to improve. A minor difficulty arose as members
of the Sovrin Foundation paid staff were laid off. As members of th"at paid staff contributed to several code projects and community
coordination within the Aries project some of those efforts briefly
struggled as other community sponsors were found to help support th"at work. That disruption unfortunately includes the timely generation of
this quarterly report. Overall, the Aries project was only very lightly
affected; meetings were held, major code projects continued work without
interruption, and releases continued. The lack of major disruption is a
credit to the health and diversity of the project and broad support of
active community members.

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

There are no issues for the TSC at this time.

# Releases

##### **<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/releases/tag/v0.1.3" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Aries Framework Go 0.1.3 (May 6,
2020)</a>**

-   Adds initial support for out-of-band, issue credential, present
proof protocols
-   Pluggable KMS/Crypto improvements
-   Verifiable credential / JSON-LD Signature improvements

##### **<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/releases/tag/v0.1.2" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Aries Framework Go 0.1.2 (Feb 26,
2020)</a>**

-   WebAssembly/JS controller target (enables loading the framework in a
browser)
-   DIDComm mediator support
-   Verifiable credential controller APIs

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Community participation is very active in rocketchat channels, community
calls, and repo PR reviews and issues. Email lists are less frequently
used.

Coordination with the DIF DIDComm working group is healthy, with regular
reports being shared.

Project work in main repos is healthy and active.

# Current Plans

-   Development and adoption of new Out Of Band and DID Exchange
protocols to solve issues with the current Connections protocol.
-   Development and adoption of new versions of Credential Exchange
Protocols for additional features.
-   New version of Interoperability Profile targeting new protocols.
-   Protocol Test Suite and Test Harness development
-   Continued shared library development.

# Maintainer Diversity

Aries is a multi-codebase effort, and each codebase has its own set of
maintainers. The diversity of maintainers closely matches contributors,
with notes below.

# Contributor Diversity

We have not tracked meeting attendance, RFC contributions, and code
contributions in a way that makes it easy to quantify contributor
diversity. Here are a few indicators of our current diversity:

-   We hold two community calls: Weekly at Noon Pacific to cover US and
Pacific contributors, and every two weeks at 7am Pacific to cover US
and European contributors.
-   Call attendance for each call is typically in the 15-20 range.
-   Most organizations have only one attendee; it is rare for more than
3 to attend from the same organization.
-   Cross codebase interoperability efforts indicate cross-organization
cooperation.

<p>Since we are flagging this on other project reports we should flag it
here too... the maintainers diversity section is not very clear. I poked
at a few repos including aries and aries-rfcs to see if I could discern
this myself, but the repos I checked do not have MAINTAINERS.md files.
With the exception of the rfcs repos I also did not see CONTRIBUTING.md
files.</p>
<p>These meta files are helpful for your community to have clear
governance and recruit and retain new contributors.</p>

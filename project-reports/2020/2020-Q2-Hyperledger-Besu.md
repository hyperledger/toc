# Project

Hyperledger Besu

# Project Health

<span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">Besu remains a strong project with a
growing community. This quarter Besu has prioritized fostering the
community around Besu and delivering its 1.5. Release. </span>

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

The Besu team doesn't have any outstanding questions or issues. The team
has been pleased with the community's response to gaining its active
status designation and the RocketChat updates that have made it more
user friendly to join the chat channels.

# Releases

Hyperledger Besu has completed eight bi-weekly patch releases (1.4.2 on
25 Mar, 1.4.3 on 8 Apr, 1.4.4 on 22 Apr, 1.4.5  RC1 on May 6, 1.4.5 RC2
on 12 May, 1.4.5 on 21 May, 1.4.6 RC1 on 29 May, 1.4.6 RC2 on 3 Jun).

Some functional improvements include:

-   <span style="color: rgb(36,41,46);letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Introduced

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

A few high-level activities include:

-   The Hyperledger Besu security audit was completed. Read the blog
with a link to the findings <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/04/15/hyperledger-besu-security-audit-2020" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">here</a> .
-   Continue to run our bi-weekly contributor calls and grow the
attendance.
-   We have been using the Hyperledger tools consistently and with
continued success. With the latest release of RocketChat, our team
is very pleased because community members can see the chat channels
without a LFID. 
-   Team completed transition to GitHub Issues from Jira issues

As a part of participating in the Hyperledger community, the Besu team
has participated in the community by:

-   Continuing to work on Besu’s support of Caliper, targeting to
publish blog in July on our work with Caliper.
-   Presented Hyperledger meet-ups, including Hyperledger Barcelona
meet-up and Hyperledger Argentina meet-up in April
-   Mark Wagner is leading the Hyperledger mentorship project to have
Besu run on OpenShift

# Current Plans

These plans remain fairly similar to our prior report published in
late-March.

1.  The project team remains currently working towards its 1.5 Release,
scheduled for July 15, 2020. The 1.5 Release is expected to include
the following features:

2.  1.  Performance improvements: Performance is a high priority item
for the Besu team at this time to ensure it’s a leading Ethereum
space. Some of the improvements will include block propagation, 
block product and validation, transaction pool management, and
JSON RPC query response time. 
2.  Privacy Improvements
3.  Preliminary Mainnet Berlin support.

3.  The Besu team is also continuing to focus on finalizing and
publishing performance metrics with its work on Hyperledger Caliper.
The publishing of the metrics was slightly delayed since last
quarter because there remains additional work for the team to get
the range of metrics and tests it requires. The team is currently
working on this task. We still believe publishing these performance
metrics will help provide the community additional context on the
project’s usability for a variety of use cases.

4.  Similar to last quarter, Besu is also continuing to engage with its
community and grow the diversity of its maintainer and contributor
base. 

# Maintainer Diversity

Our maintainer diversity remained fairly consistent from the prior
quarter.  We continue to have maintainers from four different
organizations. 

The four organizations include:

-   ConsenSys (PegaSys)
-   Web3Labs
-   Chainsafe
-   Splunk (maintainer was formerly at Machine Consultancy)

The new maintainers this quarter include:

-   Karim Taan (PegaSys)

We had a couple of maintainers leave ConsenSys in the last quarter.

The maintainers breakdown is currently:

-   21% non-PegaSys - This is an increase from 13% in the prior quarter.

# Contributor Diversity

<span style="color: rgb(29,28,29);">Commits from 2020-03-21 to

<span style="color: rgb(29,28,29);">Committers from 2020-03-21 to

<span style="color: rgb(29,28,29);">Identified Orgs  2020-03-21 to

Is there more to share here? I think the Iroha community also had issues
with multiple chat platforms in their community growth in the past. </span></p>

<p>There was a bugfix in the new version of chat to allow
un-authenticated users to read all public channels.</p>

<p>I agree with Chris here, Great Report!.</p>
<p>Would love to hear more about the performance work on a Performance
and Scalability Working Group call when your team is ready,  but I may
be biased. Until then, let the PSWG know if we can do anything to help.
BTW, Vipin is always great for quotes on blog posts, etc.</p>

<p>The subtlety of the bug fix is we can now link directly to our ch"at room whereas before we had to link to the #general room and tell new
users to go to the #besu room.  That combined with the support of making
lightweight LFIDs from github, gmail, and facebook accounts it
eliminates the friction for casual users to (a) see whats being
discussed and (b) join the discussion.</p>

<p>For this quarter the performance improvements were all below the
architecture level.  Mainly doing some profiler driven optimizations and
using native encryption libraries, such as the hand-coded assembly of
bitcoin-core secp256k1 cure.</p>
<p>In the next quarter or two there may be some interesting
architectural changes to talk about that are preparatory for stateless
ethereum (fka Eth 1.x) and Eth2 phase 2, both of which I expect to have
implementation impacts into the Besu codebase.</p>

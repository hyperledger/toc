# Project Health

New features:

-   Sawtooth 1.2 was released after an extended round of stability,
performance and regression testing. The features contained in the
1.2 release were originally reported in previous 2019 Sawtooth
quarterly updates.
-   libsawtooth was released. This Rust library begins to move Sawtooth
features into reusable code modules for other applications to
construct block chain solutions.Â  Currently, it provides a module
for transaction receipt storage. It is available via
<a href="http://crates.io" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">crates.io</a> , the standard Rust library repository.

Bug fixes:

-   Fixed timestamp check in block\_info for catchup

# Project

[Hyperledger
Avalon](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/avalon/Hyperledger+Avalon)

# Project   Health

<span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">The Avalon team has been working
according to its 2020 plan and is on track to release 0.6 version in
July. This release includes baseline implementation for the worker pools
(a foundation for the TEE scalability), separation of the key management
from the work order execution, initial K8S support and improved
cryptographic support. The team has also completed evaluation and
prototyping for LibOS runtime integration (Graphene, Occlum, SGX-LKL).
The team participated in a number of the industry events even though
Covid19 has a high negative impact in this area. The upcoming release
0.7 shall focus on auto-scaling (by utilizing K8S), LibOS runtime
integration and test automation integrated with CI.Â  The team continued
to focus on expanding its community and contributor's diversity.Â </span>

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

<span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">There are no issues for the TSC
currently. </span>

# Releases

July 2020 â€“ Release 0.6 shall address the following

-   <span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">Worker pools and key management
separation from the the work order execution </span>
-   <span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">Initial K8S support </span>
-   <span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);"> Improved cryptographic support</span>
-   Bug fixes bugs and corner cases.

The next plan is to have 0.7 release at the end of the yearÂ with 2-3
intermediate stable releases (0.6.1, 0.6.2, etc.).

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Avalon team was focused on scalability and key management isolation
along with overall code improvements and prototyping for upcoming
releases.

-   Delivered initial worker (aka enclave pool) implementation
-   Implemented KME (Key Management Enclave) and WPE (Worker order
Processing Enclave) that isolated key management from the work order
processing
-   Integrated Avalon with K8S
-   Improved cryptographic support in python modules by utilizing
"native" Python libraries instead of SWIG wrappers for C++ code
-   Added support MbedTLS library in addition to OpenSSL. It provides a
base for a broader TTE runtime supportÂ Â 
-   Updated connectors for Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Besu in
the Avalon proxy model
-   Dockerised front-end load balancer (Nginx based) to distribute
transactions to multiple listeners
-   Prototyped Graphene runtime integrationÂ Â 
-   Refactored overall code repository structure and improved build
processÂ 
-   Improved CI support
-   Improved test coverage
-   Started work on the test automation frameworkÂ 
-   Substantially improved project documentation and added Doxygen auto
API spec generation
-   Expanded WiKi documentation

Avalon team participated in the following activities:

-   Continued regular Avalon Technical Forum calls every other week with
a good community participationÂ  Â 
-   Relied on the GITHUB issues for the bug tracking and feature
requestÂ  Â Â 
-   Published several video tutorials
-   Presented Hyperledger Avalon atÂ Consensus 2020
-   Submitted Avalon tech talk proposal toÂ Grace Hopper Celebration
India (GHCI) -Â the largest gathering of women technologists in Asia
Â 
-   Continuously utilized email and rocket chat for community support

There are at least 7 active maintainers.Â Covid19 slowed community
building activities.Â 

# Current Plans

The Avalon team planned to have quarterly release but realized that this
cadence is not optimal. Primary reason is complex nature of the tasks
under development. Additional reason is a three-week sprint pattern
utilized by the team. Overall, this pattern works well for the team, but
having only four sprints between releases makes it hard to address
unforeseen changes. Based on the above the plan was changed to haveÂ Â 

-   A major project release 0.7 at the end of the 2020Â Â 
-   2-3 intermediate stable (and tagged) releases - 0.6.1., 0.6.2,
etc.
-   0.8 release in Q2 of 2021 focused on the code stability and
robustness (aka "active" stage candidate)

Next release 0.7 will focus on

-   Finalization of worker pool implementation
-   Support for multiple KME (Key Management Enclave) for the worker
pools (aka scalable key management)
-   Kubernetes integration with elastic compute support
-   Multi-tenancy support by utilize SGX KSS (Key Sharing and
Separation) to dedicate a TEE enclave for processing workloads from
a specific requester only
-   Extending SGX attestation model to support 3 <sup>rd</sup> Â  party
attestation (aka DCAP)
-   Integration of high-level LibOS runtimes (Graphene, Occlum)
-   Adding attested oracles end-to-end use case (to be contributed by Chainlink)
-   Adding test automation into CIÂ 
-   Refining Avalon Architecture with focus on auto-scaling,
multi-tenancy and TEE runtime integration

The team plans to regularly review GIHUB issues and consider utilizing
JIRA for the project management.Â  Avalon Developer Forum calls (every
other weeks) generally proofed to be frequent enough, but the team still
considers starting a new series of Avalon Architecture Forum calls.

Integrated to building up Avalon community and to mitigate Covid19
impact, the team will look for the online opportunities and will publish
technical blogs and user case studies along with additional video
tutorials.

# Maintainer Diversity

<span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">Formal Avalon maintainer list has
not changed during this quarter, but we started ramping up a new
maintainer candidate from Wipro and in the process of recruiting
maintainer candidates from three more organizations. Based on the recent
activity and our current plans we anticipate that the Avalon maintainers
list will be extended in the second half of 2020. </span>



# Contributor Diversity

Avalon project gets contributions and participation from multiple
companies â€“ Intel, WiPro, IBM, iExec, Kaleido and Santander. AntFin
Occlum team modified Occlum project according to the Avalon requirements
in preparation for Occlum runtime integration with Avalon. The project
team sees a lot of interest from and anticipates additional
contributions from ConcenSys Health and Chainlink.

Avalon Developer Forum calls happens every other week well attended by members from different organizations.Â Building up Avalon community was
less efficient during Q2 of 2020 primarily due to bigger than expected
Covid19 impact. In Q3 and Q3 of 2020 the team will work on expanding
Avalon community by more actively utilizing on-line industry events,
video tutorials and publishing blogs and case studies.

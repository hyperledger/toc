# Project Health

Hyperledger Solang development is going very well, and we have made huge strides towards compatibility with the latest Solana and Polkadot chains. We are seeing more activity on Discord and github, and we are having trouble keeping up with closing issues, answering questions, and getting new development done.

As a result, we are hiring for [two more engineers](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3691405120/) to work Hyperledger Solang.

# Questions/Issues for the TOC

There are no issues at this time.

# Releases

* 2023-05-22: Hyperledger Solang v0.3.0: Venice
* 2023-06-30: Hyperledger Solang v0.3.1: Göttingen
* 2023-08-24: Hyperldeger Solang v0.3.2: Brasília

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

* Following Polkadot/Substrate branding, the Substrate target in Solang has been renamed to Polkadot
* Discord is more active, and we have created new channels to split the incoming volume.
* Answering questions has become a time-sink, and we're considering telling users to go to stack exchange and ask their questions there. This way, answers are less ephemeral and can be be found via search engines. Answering in discord only helps one person.
* Answering questions/bug fixes has affected development of new features.
* We've had a ton of bug fixes due to more bug reports.

# Current Plans

* Do everything to support and attract Solidity developers on Solana and Polkadot
* Improve the developer experience for Solidity
* Maintain compatibility the latest Solidity version
* More security audits

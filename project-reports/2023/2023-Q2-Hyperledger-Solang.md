# Project Health

Hyperledger Solang development is going well. We have new contributors creating pull requests,
and new contributors questions in our discord channel.

# Questions/Issues for the TOC

There are no issues at this time.

# Releases

* 2023-04-06: Hyperledger Solang v0.2.3: Geneva

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

 * Solang sema module had a [security audit from trail of bits](https://github.com/solana-labs/security-audits/blob/master/solang/Trail_of_Bits_Solang_Final_report.pdf).
   No major issues were found.
 * For Solana, we have a new annotation syntax for specifying seed, bump, payer, and size for
   new contract. The syntax was inspired by Java annotations.
 * Math overflow now works for all integer types and is always enabled
 * For Substrate, chain extensions can now be used.
 * The Ethereum Solidity parser and semantic tests are now being run during tests. There are
   still failures, however we have made numerous improvements.
 * New contributors showing up in discord and are creating pull requests. The `good first issue` label
   is working well.

# Current Plans

* Do everything to support and attract Solidity developers on Solana and Substrate
* Improve the developer experience for Solidity
* Maintain compatibility with the latest Solidity version
* More security audits

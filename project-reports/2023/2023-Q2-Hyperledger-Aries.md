# Project Health

Hyperledger Aries has seen a lot of activity overall, especially in the
[Aries Framework
JavaScript](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript), [Aries
Bifold](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native) (mobile
wallet), and [Aries VCX](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx) communities.
Lots of progress being made in those projects!

The following are the highlights from this past quarter:

-   Lots of activity towards integrating [Hyperledger AnonCreds] into
    all of the Aries Frameworks to enable ledger-agnostic implementations.
    - Aries Bifold using [Hyperledger AnonCreds] has been demonstrated, as
    has deployments of [Aries Framework JavaScript] using AnonCreds objects
    rooted in [cheqd.io] and [Cardano].
    - BC Gov published an [AnonCreds Code With Us Opportunity] to integrate
    [Hyperledger AnonCreds] into [Aries Cloud Agent Python]. [Indicio]
    won that Opportunity and is working the implementation.
- An implementation of [OpenID4VCs] (issuance) with [Aries Framework JavaScript]
has been completed. This is the first experiment in using [OpenID4VCs] with Aries.
The community is also considering the feasibility of issuing and presenting [ISO
mdocs] verifiable credentials using Aries Frameworks.
-   The effort to move off the Indy SDK continued this quarter with the
    following results:
    - BC Gov published an [Askar Code With Us Opportunity] to create a
    conversion script from Indy SDK to [Aries Askar] storage. [Indicio]
    won that Opportunity, completed that implementation, and the
    result has been used to convert a production system.
    - [Animo Solutions] won a similar [AFJ Askar Code With Us Opportunity] and
    has demonstrated a deployment of [Aries Bifold] using Aries Askar storage.
-   After being awarded a BC Gov [Mobile Verifier Code With Us] opportunity, [DSR]
    implemented in the Aries Bifold wallet the ability for one wallet to request
    a presentation from another wallet, and for two wallets to establish a connection
    and communicate (messaging and presentation requests).
-   Discussions continue on Aries Interop Profile (AIP) v3.0, which extend
    AIP 2.0 to be based on DIDComm V2, and a number of Aries community
    members contributed to a DIDComm V2.0 Connect-a-thon at IIW.
-   Continued good progress was made in the community on the use of [Overlays
    Capture Architecture](https://oca.colossi.network/) (OCA) to power the
    on-screen display of credentials, as mentioned in previous reports. An Aries
    RFC has been proposed and gone through a couple of iterations, with good
    feedback -- [OCA for Aries RFC
    PR](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/755), [OCA for Aries RFC
    (proposed)](https://github.com/swcurran/aries-rfcs/tree/oca4aries/features/0755-oca-for-aries)
    and [OCA for Aries Style Guide
    (proposed)](https://github.com/swcurran/aries-rfcs/tree/oca4aries/features/0756-oca-for-aries-style-guide).
    -   OCA has been implemented in [Aries Bifold]. However, we have had a
    challenge in figuring out the best way to distribute OCA Bundles. As a short
    cut around the problem the community has created a GitHub [OCA Bundles
    repository], with a governance model allowing anyone to submit a (valid) OCA
    Bundle for their credential type. The repo is currently in the BC Gov
    GitHub organization, but may be moved as OCA Bundles become more prevalent in the
    community. A tool, the [OCA Explorer] has been built to make it easy to see
    and evolve OCA Bundles implementations. Check it out!

### [Aries Framework JavaScript]

[Aries Framework JavaScript] has made significant progress in the first
quarter of 2023. The bulk of the work has been towards implementing
ledger-agnostic AnonCreds, with an initial implementation for Hyperleger Indy,
and the work on [cheqd.io] integration started. The integration of the new shared
components (Aries Askar, AnonCreds RS and Indy VDR) has been implemented.

All the work has been going into preparation for the 0.4.0 release of Aries
Framework JavaScript, which will be the first release of the framework that is
truly ledger-agnostic. 

In addition, work has been done to expand the supported exchange protocols to
include OpenID4VCI, allow credentials to be received and shared using different
protocols.

### [Aries Cloud Agent Python]

[Aries Cloud Agent Python] v0.8.0 was released in 2023Q1, with contributions
from 32 individuals. Work this quarter was focused on enabling upgrades
of existing deployments to [Aries Askar], the use of ACA-Py
as an Aries Mediator (the [Aries Mediator Service] repository), updating
ACA-Py to use Hyperledger AnonCreds, and the launch of a new ACA-Py
documentation site [aca-py.org]

[aca-py.org]: https://aca-py.org/
[Aries Mediator Service]: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mediator-service

The Indy/Aries stack continues to be the global leader in SSI/verifiable
data solutions, with AnonCreds the most used credential format.

    the wallet-to-wallet support added in Q1, and expanding support for OCA to
    enable beautifully displayed credentials.

    all of the active Aries Frameworks.
-   Promotion of a place for issuers to publish and wallets/verifiers to use
    Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) bundles.
-   Rust [DID resolver, DID parser](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/812) in Aries VCX
    - Not specific to Aries
    - Currently implementing did:sov only, did:indy, did:web will be added next

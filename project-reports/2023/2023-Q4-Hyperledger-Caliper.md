# Releases

The latest stable release is v0.5.0; we're also continuously publishing unstable releases after every merged PR (no new releases):

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperledger/caliper-cli/v/0.5.0)
* [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/layers/caliper/hyperledger/caliper/0.5.0/images/sha256-3a7df18ef6a17a8c851dac19241049be2375dc892643c576932f360ca9d7198c?context=explore)

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

The activity has been minimal in the last quarter due to the maintainers being otherwise engaged. There's an ongoing discussion about establishing a performance-related group (of some form), along with preparing workshop materials for Webinars in 2024. We think such publicity will do good for Caliper in terms of gaining more contributors.

# Current Plans

There are no current plans, I would expect that the main interested parties of Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Besu would plan to contribute specifically to the Caliper connectors in order to ensure that Caliper continues to meet the needs of a load generator for them. However if within 6 months starting 1 Jan 2024, Caliper doesn't get any active contributors and thus see some activity then we should consider moving Caliper to the "dormant" state of the Hyperledger project lifecycle.

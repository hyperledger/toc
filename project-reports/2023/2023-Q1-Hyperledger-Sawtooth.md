# Project Health

Activity primarily focused on integration of Transact into sawtooth-lib, with
discussions about simplifying the build processes.

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

No new issues

# Releases

- sawtooth-lib v0.8.0

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Initial work on integrating transact into sawtooth-lib and initial release
(v0.8.0) was done. This is the first step in merging transact into sawtooth-lib
and eventually deprecating transact.

Various smaller updates went into sawtooth-lib, mostly to update it to the
latest Rust compiler and language features.

# Current Plans

The primary project focus currently is accessibility by potential future
contributors. In particular, the current docker-based build and deployment
approach seems like a barrier to entry; therefore, the plan is to simplify
these aspects of the project to reduce the barrier.

Adjustments to sawtooth-lib's transact integration will continue as it becomes
better integrated into the library.

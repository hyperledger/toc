# Raising an Issue with the Technical Advisory Council (TAC)

Issues specific to a project should first be raised within the project itself. Each project provides a system such as GitHub Issues for this purpose, as well as the contact information for its technical steering committee (TSC). However, if the issue is broader in nature or if you are not satisfied with the disposition by the project you may bring it up to the LF Decentralized Trust TAC for consideration. Such examples include the case where a project is evolving in a different direction than what is expected or where the project falls short of meeting the expectations set by the original project proposal.

There are multple ways you can bring up an issue to the TAC. The most direct one is to simply open an issue in [the TAC GitHub repository](https://github.com/lf-decentralized-trust/tac/issues) or to send an email to [the TAC mailing list](https://lists.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/g/tac/). Either way should get attention from the TAC.

Please, provide all relevant background information when raising an issue so that the TAC is fully equiped to process it. Failing to do so will lead the TAC to ask for that information as a first step and delay processing.

If you are unsure about how to proceed or would like to raise an issue privately consider contacting one of the [LF Decentralized Trust Community Architects](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CA/Community+Architects+Team) or one of the [TAC members](../members-info/tac-members.md). Community Architects can easily be contacted via email [community-architects@lfdecentralizedtrust.org](mailto:community-architects@lfdecentralizedtrust.org) or chat [#community-architects](https://discord.com/servers/hyperledger-foundation-905194001349627914).

# FIXME
There are still two references to hypeledger that need to be resolved when infrastructure for LFDT is established.

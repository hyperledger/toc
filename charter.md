Adopted 22 January 2016 / Last amended 7 October 2022

### 1. Mission of the Hyperledger Foundation.

The mission of the Hyperledger Foundation is to:

a. Foster and coordinate the premier community of software developers building enterprise grade open source software, in the form of platforms, libraries, tools and solutions, for multiparty systems using blockchain, distributed ledger, and related technologies.

b. Host the technical infrastructure for the Foundation, establishing a neutral home for community infrastructure, meetings, events, and collaborative discussions.

c. Drive broad adoption of the technology by building a substantial and diverse ecosystem of solution providers delivering production solutions and networks, and organizing industry end-users.

d. Advocate for the use and adoption of enterprise multiparty systems technologies through marketing, education and outreach; and work with other aligned organizations to accelerate implementation and public acceptance.

The scope of the Hyperledger Foundation includes supporting various open technical projects (including open source software, open standards / specifications, open data and other open projects, collectively, "Technical Projects". Technical Projects can either be overseen by (i) the Technical Oversight Committee of the Hyperledger Foundation (such Technical Projects, "TOC Projects", or (ii) separate technical oversight pursuant to a technical charter specific to such Technical Project (such Technical Projects, "Supported Projects".

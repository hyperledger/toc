# The Hyperledger Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) responsibilities

The [Hyperledger Charter](https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter) states that the TOC is responsible for:

1. coordinating the technical direction of the Hyperledger Foundation;

2. approving project proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation and changes to a projectâ€™s charter or scope) in accordance with a project lifecycle document to be developed, approved and maintained by the TOC;

3. creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues or opportunities;

4. communicating with external and industry organizations concerning related technical matters;

5. appointing representatives to work with other open source or standards communities;

6. establishing community norms, workflows, or policies for releases;

7. discussing, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and

8. establishing election processes for Maintainers or other leadership roles in the technical community that are not within the scope of any single project.

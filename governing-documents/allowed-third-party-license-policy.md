# LF Decentralized Trust Foundation Allowed Third Party Licenses

LF Decentralized Trust (LFDT) Foundation's IP policy is set forth in the [LF Decentralized Trust Foundation charter], section 12.

LFDT Foundation project dependencies that are licensed under Apache-2.0 do not require
further license review or approval, since they are under the same license as
the LFDT Foundation itself.

The IP policy in the [LF Decentralized Trust Foundation charter] allows the LFDT Foundation Governing
Board to review and approve other non-Apache-2.0 licenses on an exception basis.

To streamline this process, licenses for some components are allowed as per
the LFDT Foundation Allowlist License Policy (adopted by the LFDT Foundation
Governing Board on 2019-04-02).

Components that are not under Apache-2.0, and that do not satisfy the Allowlist License Policy, remain subject to review and exception approval by the Governing Board.

## LF Decentralized Trust Foundation Allowlist License Policy

A third-party component under a non-Apache 2.0 license will be deemed automatically approved by the Governing Board for use in a LFDT Foundation project as an exception to the LFDT Foundation Intellectual Property Policy, if **all** of the following apply:

1. it is fully licensable under the approved licenses set forth in [Approved Licenses] (including combinations with Apache-2.0); AND

2. it is either not stored in the LFDT repo, or else stored unmodified in a designated third-party folder in source code form; AND

3. it has indications of substantial use outside LFDT because either:

 * the component is part of the applicable programming language's standard library; or
 * the component was created on GitHub at least 12 months ago and has at least 10 stars or 10 forks.

### Approved Licenses for Allowlist

To be approved as "allowlisted," a third-party component must be fully
licenseable under one or more of the following licenses, and must meet the
other allowlist criteria set forth in the [Allowlist License Policy] above.

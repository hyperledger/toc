# Task Force

A _task force_ is a group that is focused on a task with limited scope and fixed time to complete. A task force can be created by anyone in the  LF Decentralized Trust (hereafter "LFDT") community and must be proposed to and approved by the TOC.

## Propose a Task Force
To propose a task force, create an issue in [the TOC GitHub repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/toc/issues). The issue should be named "Task Force Proposal: _\<name of task force\>_". The issue should include the following information:
* Introduction/background material
* Task to be completed
* List of deliverables or work products
* Time to complete (no more than 6 months)
* Leader
* Initial participant list

## Approval Process
The TOC will review the task force proposal first by providing comments in the issue and secondly by bringing the task force proposal to a discussion and vote in a TOC meeting.

The decision of the vote will be documented in the issue. If the task force is approved, a page in the [Task Force section of the LFDT wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TF/Task+Forces+Home) will be created.

## Reporting on Task Force Completion of Deliverables
Upon completion of the task force's deliverables, the task force should arrange a time with the TOC chair to present the deliverables at a TOC meeting. This can be accomplished by sending an email to [the TOC mailing list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/toc) at  [toc@lists.hyperledger.org](mailto:toc@lists.hyperledger.org).

## Requesting an Extension on Completion Date
If the task force is unable to complete the deliverables by the specified completion date, then the leader of the task force should arrange a time with the TOC chair to discuss the extension at a TOC meeting. This discussion should include information on the current status, the delays, and the expected updates to the schedule. This can be accomplished by sending an email to [the TOC mailing list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/toc) at  [toc@lists.hyperledger.org](mailto:toc@lists.hyperledger.org).

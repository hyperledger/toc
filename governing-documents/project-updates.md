# Project Updates

## Overview
Project updates are:
- used by the TAC to determine the health of a project
- provided to the Governing Board on a monthly basis in the TAC Update
- used to highlight interesting updates to the Governing Board about the projects
- used by the TAC chair to provide project updates at both the annual Member Summit and Global Forum
- used to share interesting information with member companies by both the staff and TAC members
- suggested as a point of reference by the Learning Materials Development WG to newcomers to determine if a project would be worth joining based on information like the contributor diversity, as well as, the type of feature work that is ongoing within the project

## Submitting Project Updates
Project reports are to be submitted as a pull request to the [hyperledger/toc](https://github.com/hyperledger/toc) repository. For instructions on how to file see: [Filing a Project Update](https://tac.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/project-reports/#instructions-for-filing)

## Merging
Project reports will be merged after 14 days from submission unless (1) there is still ongoing discussion regarding the report or (2) a majority of the TAC has not approved the PR. If all TAC  members have approved the PR before 14 days, then the PR will be merged.

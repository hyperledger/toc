Hyperledger Project Charter
---------------------------

#### The Linux Foundation \| Effective 22 January 2016

**1. Mission of Hyperledger Project ("HLP").**

The mission of HLP is to:
+ a\. create an enterprise grade, open source distributed ledger framework and code base, upon which users can build and run robust, industry-specific applications, platforms and hardware systems to support business transactions.

+ b\. create an open source, technical community to benefit the ecosystem of HLP solution providers and users, focused on blockchain and shared ledger use cases that will work across a variety of industry solutions;

+ c\. promote participation of leading members of the ecosystem, including developers, service and solution providers and end users; and

+ d\. host the infrastructure for HLP, establishing a neutral home for community infrastructure, meetings, events and collaborative discussions and providing structure around the business and technical governance of HLP.

**2. Membership.**

+ a\. HLP shall be composed of Premier, General and Associate Members. All Premier and General Members must be current corporate members of The Linux Foundation (at any level) to participate in HLP as a member. Anyone may propose a contribution to HLP's technical codebase regardless of membership status. All participants in HLP, including Associate Members, enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this Hyperledger Project Charter, as from time to time amended by the Governing Board with the approval of The Linux Foundation ("LF"). During the term of their membership, all members will comply with all such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the HLP may from time to time adopt with notice to members.

+ b\. The Associate Member category of membership is limited to non-profits, open source projects, and government entities, and requires approval by the Governing Board of HLP ("Governing Board"), or, if the Governing Board sets criteria for joining as an Associate Member, the meeting of such criteria. If the Associate Member is a membership organization, Associate Membership in HLP does not confer any benefits or rights to the members of the Associate Member.

+ <a name="s2bd"></a>d\. General Members shall be entitled to annually elect one representative to the Governing Board for every ten (10) General Members, up to a maximum of two (2) representatives, provided that there shall always be at least one (1) General Member representative, even if there are less than ten (10) General Members. The election process shall be determined by the Governing Board.

+ e. Premier Members, General Members and Associate Members shall be entitled to:

    + i. participate in Project general meetings, initiatives, events and any other activities; and

# The Hyperledger Technical Oversight Committee

The Hyperledger Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) is responsible for oversight of the Hyperledger Foundation technical communities, including approving new proposals for project lifecycle changes, establishing community norms, workflows, or policies that are not within the scope of any single project, and resolving technical matters that affect multiple projects.
